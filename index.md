### Thank you for entering my site. 

Here I will tell a bit about myself, and what I do. 

I am a dedicated and ambitious engineer within applied mathematics, who possess proven project management competences. I have a strong analytical background spiced with proficient coding skills, which can be utilized to solve complex problems. I'm driven to succeed in collaboration and love to learn new stuff.

# Master Thesis

**Title: Development of a Spectral Element Method for simlation of water waves using Incompressible Navier-Stokes Equations**

This project concerns developing of a Spectral Element Method for simulation of water waves using the Incompressible Navier-Stokes Equations. The method will be developed in a general Runge-Kutta setting, which allows for high-order time-stepping, high order spatial convergence and geometric flexibility. 

As an intermediate result a [poster](./NSE_Poster_linear.html) on the work for the linearised model was presented for the DTU 02689 class.
